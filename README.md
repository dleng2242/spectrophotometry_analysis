# Spectrophotometry Analysis

This repo contains code to analyse a spectrophotometry experiment.



## Quick start


Create a virtual environment and install the packages from the requirements.txt.
I used conda and so ran  `conda create --name py38_spectro python=3.8` and then
activated it with `conda activate py38_spectro` and then  
`pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required packages.
